# 13_Audio_transcription
This repository provides an advanced audio transcription model built using OpenAI's Whisper, designed for accurate speech-to-text conversion across multiple languages. The model efficiently processes audio recordings, generating precise transcriptions.


# how we can use the wisper-large-v3 model for the audio to text conversion
# Note: thise cell is just instruction that you have to following in following code snippets 
1. go to the groq 
2. select the model
3. generate the api
4. use that api "past_api_here" in following code 
5. download the audio if you have that greate 
6. past the "file_path" of your audio 
7. run that code cell and you will get the all the text that in your audio file
